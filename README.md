# Xtract ROI Transformation

Transformation of [XTRACT] ROIs to different templates made available via [RheMap].
Note, this is only a library of commands that perform the transformation and no data
is provided. We recommend getting the data from their original sources.

## Installation

`xtract-seeds` can be installed via `pip`:

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/kaitj/xtract-seeds
```

## Example

An example script is provided in the `script/` directory for applying
the transformation workflow. Data is assumed to be stored in a zipped
file with the same directory organization as the source.
